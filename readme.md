In this endeavor, Megaline aims to modernize its service by offering personalized plan recommendations to subscribers based on their behavior. Leveraging behavioral data from subscribers who've migrated to newer plans, the task involves crafting a model capable of suggesting either the Smart or Ultra plans.

- The objective: crafting a high-accuracy model, targeting the 0.75 accuracy threshold using the provided test dataset.
- The roadmap includes data split into training, validation, and test sets, exploring varied model configurations via hyperparameter adjustments, and robust model performance evaluations.
- Additionally, there's a challenge: sanity checking the model's robustness against the dataset's complexity.
- Each dataset entry covers monthly user behavior, encompassing call frequency, call duration, text messages, internet usage (in MB), and plan type (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0).
